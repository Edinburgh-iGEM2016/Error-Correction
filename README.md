# Error-Correction

BabblED utilises a powerful system of error correction using checksums, optimal rectangular codes and levenshtein distance to ensure fideltity of data even when a DNA sequence is damaged or there are mistakes in sequencing. Using these and the incredible properties of DNA we can be confident in accurately storing archival data for 10s or even 100s of years.
